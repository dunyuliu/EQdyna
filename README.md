# EQdyna  

A parallel Finite Element software to model earthquake spontaneous dynamic ruptures. The software is designed to use high-performance computing. It is written in FORTRAN 90 and MPI.

## Features

EQdyna features 1) 3D under-integrated hexahedral elements stabilized by hourglass control; 
2) explicit central difference time integration for efficient and accurate modeling of wave propagation;
3) the traction-at-split-node technique to model earthquake faults or fractures;
4) the perfectly matched layer absorbing boundary;
5) the coarse-grained Q model for attenuation of seismic waves;
6) various forms of friction laws including slip-weakening, time-weakening, rate- and state- friction with the aging law, slip law and dynamic weakening;
7) 3D MPI. 

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
